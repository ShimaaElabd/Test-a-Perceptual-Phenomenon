# Test a Perceptual Phenomenon

In this project,I have investigated a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect.

I've created a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then invistigate some data collected from others who have performed the same task and compute some statistics describing the results.
Finally, I've interpreted the results in terms of hypotheses in conclusion in the end of my notebook.
